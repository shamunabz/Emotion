# Emotion

This project captures real-time video through a webcam and analyzes facial expressions using the DeepFace library to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. It visually highlights the detected face by drawing a bounding box around it and displays the dominant emotion on the screen. The program continuously updates in real time, making it an interactive way to track emotional responses, and can be exited by pressing 'q'.
